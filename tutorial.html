<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Relational data is characterized by the rich structure it encodes in
the dependencies between the individual entities of a given domain.
Statistical Relational AI (StarAI) combines first-order logic and
probability to learn and reason over relational domains by creating
parametric probability distributions over relational structures <span
class="citation" data-cites="SRL_LISA SRL_LUC"></span>. StarAI models
can succinctly represent the complex dependencies in relational data and
admit learning and inference under uncertainty. Such expressivity allows
for StarAI models to be used in various applications that simultaneously
require knowledge representation, learning, reasoning and uncertainty
quantification. These models have been extensively used in domains like
social network analysis <span class="citation"
data-cites="Problog"></span>, synthesizing biological networks <span
class="citation" data-cites="Brouard2013-iw"></span> and for various
problems on knowledge graphs <span class="citation"
data-cites="bellomarini2022swift Nickel2015ARO"></span>. Furthermore,
many widely used Neuro-Symbolic approaches for integrating neural
networks with symbolic methods have been obtained as neural extensions
of StarAI models <span class="citation"
data-cites="belle2023statistical DeepProblog jaeger marra2020neural"></span>
. A key feature of StarAI models is the inherent interpretability and
explainability. These features have lead to significant interest in
applying StarAI models to safety critical areas like Healthcare <span
class="citation" data-cites="medicine natarajan2017markov"></span> and
for analyzing complex social <span class="citation"
data-cites="social zhang2014identifying"></span> and biological systems
<span class="citation"
data-cites="riedel2009markov sakhanenko2010markov"></span>.</p>
<p>The need for using StarAI models at scale is consistently rising with
the ever-increasing quantities of relational data. However, StarAI
models are significantly limited when it comes to the
<strong>tractability</strong> of learning and inference. This limitation
emerges from the intractability of Weighted First Order Model Counting
(WFOMC) <span class="citation" data-cites="Symmetric_Weighted"></span>,
as both learning and inference in many StarAI models can be reduced to
instances of WFOMC. Furthermore, fundamental properties expected of
sound statistical models, like <strong>consistency</strong> of parameter
estimation, do not hold for StarAI models.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will focus on both tractability and consistency
of StarAI models from a foundational perspective. The tutorial will be
divided into two focus-topic. First focus-topic will be on tractable
WFOMC, where we will discuss the recent developments in the fragments of
first order logic that admit tractable WFOMC. In the second focus-topic,
we will discuss consistency of parameter estimation and generalization
behavior of StarAI models across different domain sizes. The learning
goal of the tutorial would be to convey state-of-the-art knowledge of
foundations of StarAI models, the existing open-problems, and to
motivate further applications of recently introduced theoretical
results.</p>
<h1 id="target-audience-prerequisites-and-learning-goals">Target
Audience, Prerequisites and Learning Goals</h1>
<p>Recent years have seen increasing interest in Relational AI within
the KR community. This interest is reflected in consistent StarAI
related events in previous editions of KR, including David Pooleâ€™s 2020
keynote speech on StarAI, and the tutorial of Braun, Gehrke and Wilhelm
at KR 2023. In this tutorial, we will bring to attention some
foundational problems in StarAI. Hence, our tutorial will be of interest
to the existing StarAI community at KR. Furthermore, our tutorial is
also interesting to the community of complexity analysis of reasoning.
As it will contain a thorough introduction to key ideas behind tractable
WFOMC. We believe that this tutorial can be attended by anyone with
basic knowledge of probability and first order logic.</p>
<p>The attendees will learn about the relation between problems like:
model counting and probabilistic inference; the complexity of model
counting problems; and about fragments of first order logic that admit
tractable WFOMC. The tutorial will guide the audience through some of
the key combinatorial ideas behind tractable WFOMC. The tutorial will
also discuss the current state-of-the-art first-order model counters,
their applications and their inefficiencies. The audience will be made
aware of both theoretical and practical open-problems, whose resolution
would lead to efficient probabilistic inference and learning in StarAI
models.</p>
<p>The attendees will also be introduced to the problem of consistency
of inference, and the recently developed theories of StarAI models that
admit consistent parameter estimation. Such models, also known as
<em>projective models</em>, open up a vast array of new avenues in
StarAI, and the tutorial will provide the audience with the most recent
developments. The audience will gain deep understanding of present
theoretical models of projectivity and their recent applications.
Finally, we will also discuss some recent results on domain-size
generalization of non-projective models, and discuss how simple
techniques like parameter re-scaling and regularization lead to provably
better generalization across domain sizes.</p>
<h1 id="tutorial-outline">Tutorial Outline</h1>
<p>The tutorial will be divided into three parts:</p>
<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>
<p>[30 Minutes] We will first discuss some background on relational data
and probability distributions on relational structures. We will
formalize a general notion of probabilistic inference on relational
data, and show how it maps to WFOMC for StarAI models like Markov Logic
Networks and Problog. We will provide some initial examples, where
tractability and inconsistency of inference can be major hurdles in real
life applications.</p>
<h3 id="tractability">Tractability</h3>
<p>[60 Minutes] This session will focus on conveying the key recent
results in the field of WFOMC. We will first introduce the notion of
types and tables in first order logic. We will then provide a thorough
introduction to WFOMC in the universally quantified fragment of first
order logic with two variables, providing a closed form formula for
WFOMC of any universally quantified two-variable formula <span
class="citation" data-cites="Symmetric_Weighted"></span>. We will then
extend this result to admit existential quantifiers using the principle
of inclusion-exclusion <span class="citation"
data-cites="broeck2013 MalhotraS22"></span>. Finally, we will extend
these results to admit cardinality constraints and counting quantifiers
<span class="citation" data-cites="kuzelka2020weighted"></span>. The
tutorial will convey key algorithmic and combinatorial ideas <span
class="citation" data-cites="MalhotraS22"></span> that will bring the
audience a deep understanding of the state-of-the-art WFOMC. We will
introduce key open problems in this area, ranging from scalability of
existing model counters <span class="citation"
data-cites="pmlr-v161-bremen21a"></span> to fine-grain analysis of known
(potentially sub-optimal) upper-bounds on complexity of WFOMC. Finally,
we will give a brief overview of recent results that allow for efficient
model counting in first order logic fragments, with graph-theoretic
constraints <span class="citation"
data-cites="LI_Tree Malhotra2023LiftedIB"></span>. Such constraints,
such as axiomatising a relation to represent a tree, forest, a connected
graph etc., significantly extend the tractable fragment of WFOMC.</p>
<h3 id="consistency">Consistency</h3>
<p>[60 Minutes] We will begin by introducing recent results <span
class="citation" data-cites="Projectivity_Rinaldo"></span> that have
shown that a large variety of widely used probabilistic models,
encompassing almost all of existing StarAI models <span class="citation"
data-cites="Projectivity_first"></span>, do not admit basic
<em>consistency</em> requirements expected of sound statistical models.
The lack of such consistency conditions means that StarAI models do not
admit consistency of parameter estimation, i.e., as you see more and
more data, it is not true that your parameters converge to the true
value of the model parameters. Such inherent inconsistencies in StarAI
models make them hard to be used across varying domain sizes <span
class="citation" data-cites="DA_MLN"></span>. We will discuss recent
theoretical developments in identifying fragments of StarAI models, that
admit consistency of parameter estimation <span class="citation"
data-cites="ECML_PROJ Felix_Weit"></span>. These fragments also admit
tractable inference in the strongest theoretical sense, as inference
complexity is independent of the domain size. We will discuss the
recently introduced rich theoretical framework for projective models
<span class="citation" data-cites="ijcai2020p591"></span>, and the
recent developments in their practical implementation and applications
<span class="citation" data-cites="jaeger2023a"></span>. We will
especially focus on the vast array of potential applications of these
models in problems like reasoning over large scale data and random
relational structure generation <span class="citation"
data-cites="jaeger2023a"></span>. Finally, we will look into recent
developments in understanding generalization properties of StarAI models
that do not admit consistent parameter estimation <span class="citation"
data-cites="DA_MLN chen2024understanding"></span>, and how simple
regularization and re-scaling approaches can lead to provably improved
domain-size generalization in practice.</p>
<p>We will close the session with a discussion on open problems and
potential new applications in this domain.</p>
